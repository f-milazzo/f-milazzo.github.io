    <div id="what_i_am_doing" class="content">
        <p>Currently pursuing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering at TU Delft, my track is High-Tech engineering, within the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/me/about/departments/precision-and-microsystems-engineering-pme" target="_blank">Precision and Microsystems Engineering</a> department.
            At PME, research, industry and teaching meet to push the boundaries of technology further every day ‚Äî a process I am proud to be part of. <br> 
            The department's purpose is to scale mechanical engineering to the micro&nano world, with applications that range from high-accuracy sensing to chip manufacturing.
            I am happy to say that the strong collaboration with industry can be felt throughout the curriculum, that never loses focus on the real-world validity of the applications. 
        </p>
        <p>My focus has been in the area of dynamics and mechanism design, fields that I find to be both interesting and at the true hearth of the mechanical engineering of tomorrow.<br>
            In today's technological landscape, that is becoming more and more demanding in terms of high-volume production, the study (and design) of mechanisms' dynamics
            is a vital task, to achieve balanced, accurate designs.<br>
            On the other hand, accuracy and repeatability requirements are also increasing, especially in delicate and/or hostile environments. Traditional solutions struggle to deliver acceptable results. 
            Such requirements ask for different design frameworks, where functionality is achieved through new embodiments, such as compliant mechanisms and metamaterials.
        </p>
        <p>Every task and project that I undertake, I approach with curiosity and determination,
         to deliver ingenious, reliable solutions that go above and beyond.</p>

    <div id="who_i_am" class="content"> 
        <p>Born in Milan - Italy, in 2002, I had a passion for all things technical since I was a kid. Inspired by my grandad's career
            as a mechanical engineer in the Italian automotive scene, I attended a scientific highschool, strengthening my interest on the subject.<br>
            A BSc in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico of Milano, Italy's best technical university, turned out to be the perfect choice for my Undergraduate studies<br>
            After graduation, I seeked new experiences in different settings, and chose TUDelft's MSc in Mechanical Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of the engineering world, my main interests are ice hockey and roadtrips.</p>
        <p>I started playing ice hockey in 2023, in Milano, and immediately fell in love for the sport. Not only is it fun to practice,
            but I also found it to be a great way to connect with new people and build a team.

            </figure>
        </p>
        <p>During summer break, I always squeeze in at least one trip with my friends or my family. I love the feeling of being on the road,
            with nothing but a cool picture as a destination, not knowing what the itinerary or the stops will be. <br> 
            In my dad's VW bus, I have taken trips across Italy, Europe and North Africa, meeting incredible people and discovering new cultures.
            Unplugging from the technical side of my life allows me to recharge my creativity, and get back to work with a fresh mind and
            new ideas.

        Disclaimer: I do not know HTML language, though I know a couple natural ones and luckily for me ChatGPT knows them all.
        It wrote the HTML code, I just wrote the texts and chose the pictures. I am a Mechanical Engineer after all: Matlab and Python are more up my alley.
