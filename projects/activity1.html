<p>Since 2021, I have been restoring and maintaining my grandad's VW 1302 SuperBeetle. This project, both fun and sentimentally valuable,
    has been a nice opportunity to do some hands-on dirty work.</p>        
    <p>Diving into the inner workings of the systems of this '71 car to identify and fix faults (that just never seem to end), gives me a chance to see
        the ingenious, simple solutions that engineers came up with 50+ years ago.
    </p><p>
       I am proud to say that I have made this car once again roadworthy. Starting from the fuel pump and tank, I replaced/fixed 
       various components: the ignition, radio system, starter motor, sliding windows and speedometer were all in need of some love.

    Future plans for this project include some much-needed bodywork and an additional sound system under the back seat.
