    During the summer of 2019, I designed and installed a 24V photovoltaic system in a mountain hut. 
    We mounted solar panels on the roof, routed wiring along the house and installed a battery pack and a charge regulator.

<p>By the end of the project, the house was fully self-sufficient, operating solely on solar power, without any kind of generator or connection to the electrical grid.</p>
