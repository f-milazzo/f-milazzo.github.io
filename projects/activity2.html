    During the summer of 2019, I planned and installed a 24V photovoltaic system in a mountain hut. 
    We mounted solar panels on the roof, routed lines along the house and installed a battery pack and a charge regulator.

<p>At the end of the project, the house could run under its own power, without any kind of generator or connection to the elecetrical grid.</p>
