    <p>This project consisted of the multidisciplinary conceptual design of a mechanical press, 
        based on commercially available options, followed by the dimensioning of the mechanical components.
    </p>
    <p>After the initial brainstorming had been carried out and requirements set, a double-point crank/slider mechanism
        was chosen.
    </p>

    <p>My focus in this project lay on the preliminary kinematic analysis needed to set the dimensions of the actuation mechanism,
        and the final vibrational analysis on the whole transmission. Furthermore, I designed and dimensioned
        the rod, and carried out the calculations needed to set the electric motor's requirements.
    </p>
    <p>Having chosen a simple crank-slider mechanism, the kinematic analysis focused on the length of the 
        rod, given a crank radius of 150mm set by the product requirements.

        The goal of this analysis was to find a suitable characteristic ratio λ = r/l that would minimize the velocity of the
        slider towards the end of its stroke, where it comes into contact with the workpiece.

    <p>A ratio of λ = 1/10 was eventually selected, as it allowed for performance close to the ideal case of λ = 0, within a reasonable size.</p>
    <p>The rod dimensioning process was aimed at maximizing the precision of the pressing process, i.e. minimizing its compression
        under the nominal load of 250ton.<br>
    A simple, sturdy design was reached after some iterations, resulting in a total compression of 0.13mm, less than 2%
    of the rated tonnage point RTP = 10mm (the nominal stroke).

    <p>After additional stress analysis steps, the detailed design was also carried out.
        Bearings were selected based on the load and predicted lifetime, and the design of the rod was
    adapted to facilitate assembly and maintenance.</p>

    <p>Regarding the vibrational analysis, the whole drive-slider transmission was analyzed.

    Inertia and stiffness parameters were computed from the CAD models and through FEM, respectively. The latter was in particular computed
    by applying a unit load and measuring the displacement of the point of interest, for each component.

    Damping parameters were obtained by arbitrarily setting the damping ratio at 0.5%, and computing Rayleigh's parameters α and β,
    under the hypothesis of low damping.
</p>
<p>The system was first analyzed without the crank-slider, to obtain linear analytical solutions
    that were used for a modal analysis. The crank slider was then reintroduced, together with the fabrication load.<br>
    In the absence of a control model for the electric motor, its angular velocity was set to be constant. The effect on the irregularity parameter
    i = (ω_max − ω_min)/ω_av of the fabrication periodic load was studied.
</p>
    <p>This complete model was described through non-linear EOMs, which were divided between free and constrained DOFs and solved numerically</p>

    <p>The numerical solution was used to check whether or not the initial requirements on irregularity i 
        had been satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>The aim of this multidisciplinary project was to strengthen the soft skills of the 4 participants,
        through group-work and presentation, as well as experience first-hand the process of product design.
        Literature, ISO standards and commercial products were both analyzed and implemented, to deliver a final product
        that satisfied the product requirements.
